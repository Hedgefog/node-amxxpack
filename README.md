## ðŸ¦¸ Advanced configuration

### Third-party dependencies
In case your project requires third-party modules you can specify a link to third-party archives and these archives will be downloaded and extracted to the third-party directory.
```json
{
  "thirdparty": {
    "dir": "./.thirdparty",
    "dependencies": [
      {
        "name": "somemodule",
        "url": "https://website/somemodule-v100.zip"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

the configuration above will download `somemodule-v100.zip` archive and extract it to the `./.thirdparty/somemodule` directory then you can use thirparty files in your project. For example, add a third-party directory to the include list:
```json
{
    "include": [
      "./.thirdparty/somemodule/include"
    ]
}
```

### Multiple directories as an input
You can use multiple directories as builder inputs, just specify an array of directories in the project configuration. Example:

```json
  {
    "input": {
      "scripts": ["./src/scripts", "./src/extra-scripts"],
      "include": ["./src/include", "./src/extra-include"],
      "assets": ["./assets", "./extra-assets"]
    }
  }
```

### Assets filtering and subdirectories
Using glob filters you can specify which assets should be copied.

For example, you can exclude all assets except `*.mdl`:
```json
  {
    "input": {
      "assets": [
        { "dir": "./assets", "filter": "*.mdl" }
      ]
    }
  }
```

or exclude `*.tga` and `*.wav` files:
```json
  {
    "input": {
      "assets": [
        { "dir": "./assets", "filter": "*.!(tga|wav)" }
      ]
    }
  }
```

You can also specify subdirectories for copying. With this configuration, the builder will copy all files from `./assets/models` to `./models/myproject` of the project build directory.
```json
  {
    "input": {
      "assets": [
        { "dir": "./assets/models", "dest": "./models/myproject" }
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Compiler configuration
Using the `compiler` configuration you can specify the compiler version you want to use.

For example, if you want to use AmxModX 1.9 with `cstrike` addon in your project, then use this configuration:
```json
{
  "compiler": {
    "version": "1.9",
    "addons": ["cstrike"]
  }
}
```

In case you want to use a dev build from `amxxdrop` you should set `dev` flag to `true` and specify the build you want to use in the `version` field:
```json
{
  "compiler": {
    "version": "1.10.0-git5467",
    "dev": true,
    "addons": ["cstrike"]
  }
}
```
